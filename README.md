## California Housing Interactive Visualization 
This project is a D3.js-based interactive data visualization exploring California housing data. It features a scatterplot of housing locations by longitude and latitude, linked to two dynamic histograms showing distributions of median housing price and median housing age.

Users can brush a rectangular region on the map to highlight corresponding records in the histograms, enabling interactive geographic and feature-based filtering.

Built with D3 JavaScript.
